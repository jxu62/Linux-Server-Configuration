Linux Server Configuration
This is the last project of Full Stack Web Dev Nanodegree. It is a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host my web applications. I have secured my server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy the Item Catalog web applicatons onto it.

Skills Horned
A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, youâ€™ll be responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.
